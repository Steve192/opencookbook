## Motivation
Since i like to cook in my free time and i am a person who likes to get the same taste every time i cook the same meal, i use a variety of recipes with exact instructions and ingredients. i use either family recipes or recipes from the various cooking sites on the internet.

My problem has always been to be able to put them all in one place without having to go to many different sites.


On the other hand, I am a software developer who likes to try new technologies from time to time. This time my goal was to build a scalable cloud native application. This is how opencookbook came into being.
